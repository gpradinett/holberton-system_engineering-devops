2. Show your Bash PID
```
Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

Requirements:

- You cannot use pgrep
- The third line of your script must be # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error here)

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ sylvain@ubuntu$ ./2-show_your_bash_pid
sylvain   4404  0.0  0.7  21432  4000 pts/0    Ss   03:32   0:00          \_ -bash
sylvain   4477  0.0  0.2  11120  1352 pts/0    S+   03:40   0:00              \_ bash ./2-show_your_bash_PID
sylvain   4479  0.0  0.1  10460   912 pts/0    S+   03:40   0:00                  \_ grep bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
```
<sub>Here we can see that my Bash PID is 4404.

## [3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy]()
```
3. Show your Bash PID made easy
```
Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word `bash`.

Requirements:
- You cannot use `ps`

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy
4404 bash
4555 bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy
4404 bash
4557 bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
```
<sub>Here we can see that:
- <sub>For the first iteration: `bash` PID is 4404 and that the `3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy` script PID is `4555`
- <sub>For the second iteration: `bash `PID is `4404` and that the `3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy` script PID is `4557`

## [**4-to_infinity_and_beyond**]()
```
4. To infinity and beyond
```
Write a Bash script that displays _`To infinity and beyond indefinitely`_.

Requirements:
- In between each iteration of the loop, add a `sleep 2`
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./4-to_infinity_and_beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
^C
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
```
<sub>Note that I `ctrl+c` (killed) the Bash script in the example.

## [**5-dont_stop_me_now**]()
```
Don't stop me now!
```
We stopped our `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` process using `ctrl+c` in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.

Write a Bash script that stops `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` process.

Requirements:

- You must use `kill`

Terminal #0
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./4-to_infinity_and_beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond

sylvain@ubuntu$ 
```
Terminal #1
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./5-dont_stop_me_now 
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
```
<sub>I opened 2 terminals in this example, started by running my `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` Bash script in terminal #0 and then moved on terminal #1 to run `5-dont_stop_me_now`. We can then see in terminal #0 that my process has been terminated.

## [**6-stop_me_if_you_can**]()
```
6. Stop me if you can
```
Write a Bash script that stops `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` process.

Requirements:

- You cannot use `kill` or `killall`

Terminal #0
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./4-to_infinity_and_beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond

sylvain@ubuntu$ 
```
Terminal #1
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./6-stop_me_if_you_can
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
```
<sub>I opened 2 terminals in this example, started by running my `4-to_infinity_and_beyond `Bash script in terminal #0 and then moved on terminal #1 to run `6-stop_me_if_you_can`. We can then see in terminal #0 that my process has been terminated.

## [**7-highlander**]()
```
7. Highlander
```
Write a Bash script that displays:
- `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely
- With a `sleep 2` in between each iteration
- `I am invincible!!!` when receiving a `SIGTERM` signal

Make a copy of your `6-stop_me_if_you_can` script, name it `67-stop_me_if_you_can`, that kills the `7-highlander` process instead of the `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` one.

Terminal #0
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./7-highlander
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
I am invincible!!!
To infinity and beyond
I am invincible!!!
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./67-stop_me_if_you_can
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./67-stop_me_if_you_can
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
```
<sub>I started `7-highlander` in Terminal #0 and then run `67-stop_me_if_you_can` in terminal #1, for every iteration we can see `I am invincible!!!` appearing in terminal #0.

## [**8-beheaded_process**]()
```
8. Beheaded process
```
Write a Bash script that kills the process `7-highlander`.

Terminal #0
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./7-highlander 
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
Killed
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
```
Terminal #1
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./8-beheaded_process
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
```
<sub>I started `7-highlander` in Terminal #0 and then run `8-beheaded_process` in terminal #1 and we can see that the `7-highlander` has been killed.

## [**100-process_and_pid_file**]()
```
Process and PID file
```
Write a Bash script that:

- Creates the file /var/run/myscript.pid containing its PID
- Displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely
- Displays I hate the kill command when receiving a SIGTERM signal
- Displays Y U no love me?! when receiving a SIGINT signal
- Deletes the file /var/run/myscript.pid and terminates itself when receiving a SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signal
